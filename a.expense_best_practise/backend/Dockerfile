# Key Benefits of Multi-Stage Build

#  Smaller Image Size ‚Äì The final image doesn‚Äôt include unnecessary
#        build dependencies (e.g., npm cache, extra packages)
#  Improved Security ‚Äì Runs as a non-root user (raghu) instead of root
#  Better Performance ‚Äì The image loads faster and runs efficiently

WORKDIR /app

USER raghu
CMD ["node","index.js"]

# NOW RAGHU becomes the owner of /app, even though he's not root USER.
# He can read/write/run in /app as it's owned by him.

# üí° Real-world use:
# Non-root user owns the app directory ‚Üí safer containers üîê

# DB_host=mysql ; this is the main connecting point from backend to mysql; without this the data wont flow
# to mysql -- why DB_HOST has to be taken as variable is ; in the .js files ,
# the code tells that " it will read DB_HOST for database URL"
